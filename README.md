# phase_collision_detection
## Team members: Alexander Szendy, Juraj Maslej

## Topic of our project
### V-Clip: narrow phase collision detection
#### Scene: Two 2D convex poly-line objects
Implement object definition, 
either read line segment positions from text file
or implement user interface to create poly-line by clicking on canvas <br>
<p>
Implement simplified 2D V-Clip algorithm  <br>
Implement method ClipVertex() for VV and VE case  <br>
Implement method ClipEdge() for VE and EE case  <br>
Implement user interaction with object 
</p>

User can move object (rotation is optional) <br>
Show closest points (features) on both geometries <br>

## Our progress so far
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmj4MT5yGOU
### Code in progress is on branch 'vpython'
Implemented scene with 2 objects.
Scene is scalable, user can rotate screen
### Objects
User can move objects
Closest vertices are marked
