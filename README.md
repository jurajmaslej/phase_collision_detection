## Team members: Juraj Maslej Alexander Szendy

## Topic of our project
### V-Clip: narrow phase collision detection
Scene: Two 2D convex poly-line objects
Implement object definition
either read line segment positions from text file
or implement user interface to create poly-line by clicking on canvas
Implement simplified 2D V-Clip algorithm
Implement method ClipVertex() for VV and VE case
Implement method ClipEdge() for VE and EE case
Implement user interaction with object
User can move object (rotation is optional)
Show closest points (features) on both geometries
