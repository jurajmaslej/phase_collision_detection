# phase_collision_detection
## Team members: Alexander Szendy, Juraj Maslej

## Topic of our project
### V-Clip: narrow phase collision detection
#### Scene: Two 2D convex poly-line objects
Implement object definition
either read line segment positions from text file
or implement user interface to create poly-line by clicking on canvas <br>

Implement simplified 2D V-Clip algorithm
Implement method ClipVertex() for VV and VE case
Implement method ClipEdge() for VE and EE case
Implement user interaction with object <br>

User can move object (rotation is optional) <br>
Show closest points (features) on both geometries
